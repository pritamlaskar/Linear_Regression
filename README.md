# Linear_Regression
A statistical measure that attempts to determine the strengths of the relationship between one dependent variable (usually denoted by y) and a series of the other changing variable (known as independent variable). In another word: Regression is an mathematical technique used to estimate the cause and effect relationship among variables.

</br>
• ***LinearRegression_InterestRate*** : Here we try to predict the interest for bank loans. </br>
• ***LinearRegression_LabourEarning*** : We predict earning rate of labours, data from Govt of India's Ministry of Labour. Includes LinearRegression, OLS, StandardScaler, and basic EDA (data cleaning, multicollinearity, and data visualisation).</br>
• ***LinearRegression_WalmartSales***: We take Walmart Sales dataset from Kaggle and perform basic EDA and make Linear Regression model and OLS using sklearn and statsmodels respectively. We also check for multicollinearity using VIF.
